## A pair of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix

## Creates a special "matrix" object that can 
## cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Computes the inverse of the special "matrix"

## If the inverse has already been calculated 
## (and the matrix has not changed), then the inverse 
## is retrieved from the cache

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
